# Associative

Associative structure is best illustrated by the knowledgebase everyone is familiar with: Wikipedia.

MediaWiki \(the software that powers Wikipedia\) supports linking to other _pages_, while software such as RoamResearch supports linking to _blocks_ \(e.g. sentences in other pages\).  Regardless of the technical details, in such a structure, knowledge is _associated_ with other knowledge through mechanisms like links or tags.

The underlying structure of your knowledge _emerges_ from these many interrelationships - some concepts may find themselves frequently referenced, while others may link to others or even largely be isolated.

For PKBs arranged dominantly in this fashion, you'll frequently see the use of:

* A Graph View \(e.g. [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/features#graph-view)\)
* Index notes: Instead of using folders to group notes under a "concept", _other notes_ \(or perhaps "higher-order notes"?\) will be used to collate notes under a concept via _links_.
