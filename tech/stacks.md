# Features

In terms of choosing tools for my PKB, this is my priority order for features:

1. **Privacy**. Different people will feel differently about this, but I personally believe that the contents of your brain shouldn’t be accessible to anyone but you.
2. **Portability and Backups**. If you have good portability, then just make sure you’re backing your data up. Otherwise, make sure your knowledge won’t be lost if your house burns down.
3. **High Quality Text Editing**. What this means is unique for everyone - for me, opening my PKB as a project, editor tabs and tab cycling, multi-cursor, plenty of keyboard shortcuts \(so I never use the mouse\), markdown syntax highlighting, and jump to file are some of the main things I care about.  Of course, a healthy plugin ecosystem that adds support for features like table-of-contents or tables in a portable fashion is a big plus.
4. **Wikilinking**. The ability to reference other notes and sections in your project, follow links, automate refactors \(updating links if you move a file\), auto-complete \(suggesting files to link to\), and view backlinks.
5. **Render Mode**. The ability to view a prettified render of your files, handling things like headers, image embeds, tables, etc.
   * A really nice flourish is plugin support for rendering typed codeblocks in specific ways: `mermaid` for diagrams, `latex` for math, `d3` for viz, `remark` for slides, etc.
