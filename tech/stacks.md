# Stacks

In terms of choosing tools for my PKB, this is my priority order for features:

1. Privacy. Different people will feel differently about this, but I personally believe that the contents of your brain shouldn’t be accessible to anyone but you.
2. Portability and Backups. If you have good portability, then just make sure you’re backing your data up. Otherwise, make sure your knowledge won’t be lost if your house burns down.
3. High Quality Text Editing. What this means is unique for everyone - for me, opening my PKB as a project, editor tabs and tab cycling, multi-cursor, plenty of keyboard shortcuts \(so I never use the mouse\), markdown syntax highlighting, and jump to file are some of the main things I care about.
4. Wikilinking. The ability to reference other notes and sections in your project, with automated refactors \(updating links if you move a file\), auto-complete \(suggesting files to link to\), and viewing backlinks.
5. Render Mode. The ability to view a prettified render of your files, handling standard markdown features like image embeds, etc.
   * A really nice flourish is plugin support for rendering typed codeblocks in specific ways: `mermaid` for diagrams, `latex` for math, `d3` for viz, `remark` for slides, etc.
6. Metadata Support. I generally believe that metadata frontmatter should be kept to a minimum, but some very parsimonious use can be a healthy way to work around not using non-standard directives and giving plugins a way to support useful features like tags or a graph view.

### October 2020

My current stack is: `sublimetext`, `markdown`, and `git`.

I strongly prioritize the first 3 features, to the point of being willing to forgo the last two.  However, quite a few new tools are being developed in this space, and some are promising candidates to accomplish all 6 of these feature points.
