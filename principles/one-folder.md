# One Folder

One general rule I have is that I should be able to set any device of mine on fire at any moment without concern for my data.

I accomplish this by putting everything important into a single folder, and ensuring this is synchronized across all of my devices.  This includes a variety of things:

* Notes
* Old Homework
* Dotfiles \(e.g. my `.gitconfig` lives here, and is symlinked to `~/.git/.gitconfig`\)

This has the additional benefit that whenever I need to set up a new computer, all I have to do is synchronize this folder onto it, tweak a few settings, and I'm ready to be productive!
