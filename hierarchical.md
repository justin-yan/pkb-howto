# Hierarchical

Hierarchical structure is what we are generally most familiar with on a day-to-day basis: the folder systems on our computers are hierarchical \(each folder can be in at most one other folder\).  Advocates of associative structure warn about using folders and the risks of too much hierarchy, and while their advice is pretty good, I still think there are some good reasons for using folders.

The first argument in favor of using an associative structure is that an Index note _should_ be able to mimic any folder structure. After all, isn’t a folder called `Work` containing a few files basically the same thing as a file called `Work.md` that holds _links_ to those same files?  And if you use a folder, all of those files can't be in any other folder - but what if one of them is also relevant for, say, `School`?  In this sense, isn't a folder strictly worse than linking?

The downside of hierarchical structure \(the _exclusionary_ nature of putting something into a folder\) does result in a couple of concrete benefits:

1. Folders have a standard and well-supported visualization \(the folder tree/project explorer\) which lets you explore and locate knowledge very quickly. As far as graph views have come, they are still not nearly as concise, and I don't know anyone who maintains the strawman of 2000 files in a folder.
2. Folders have a variety of _folder-level operations_, that provide a lot of ease for _encapsulating_ and _operating on_ a chunk of knowledge as an entire block. It’s not impossible, but much harder to do the same with the links, because many files could link to the same note.

The exclusionary nature of folders, however, is a very substantial downside.  When you stick something in a folder, it can only be in that one folder, which is a tricky limitation because most of the things we call “subjects” are moderately arbitrary boundaries we’ve drawn around collections of facts. For example, should `Behavioral Finance` go in an `Economics` folder or a `Psychology` folder? Should `Game Theory` go in `Math` or `Economics`?

In truth, it doesn't actually matter.  Hierarchy exists as a convenience for encapsulating bits of your knowledge, but there is no “correct structure”, and indeed, different ways of grouping subjects can present new insights and connections.  Knowledge is a series of standalone facts and insights, and the “subjects” we construct \(Biology, Economics, Psychology, Math, etc.\) are _**conventions**_ for grouping these facts together in a way that makes them more understandable. These groupings are often useful, but at the same time, ultimately arbitrary.  As a result I’ve largely settled on the following rules when it comes to folders:

1. Use some folders.
2. Don’t use too many folders.
3. You’ll know what the right balance is based on how productive you are vs. much time you waste dealing with folders.
4. Don’t implement workflow with folders. I’ve found that I like using different workflows in different parts of my PKB, and every time I’ve created workflows involving folders \(e.g. “Current Actions” and “Next Actions” folders\), I’ve found myself regularly rebuilding the whole thing \(and wasting time\).
5. Don’t worry too much about the exclusion problem: using the `behavioral finance` example, I will generally just quickly put it in whatever feels right \(`economics`\), or mix in the use of associative links \(put it next to `economics` and `psychology` and reference it from within those other folders\), or just **duplicate** it into both of them.  You can even do all three of these at the same time.
