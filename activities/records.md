# Reading

How often have you finished a book only to retain the vaguest sense of what you just read?

This is anecdotally a pretty common occurrence, and I've found that my recall improves when I introduce a few additional practices:

* Engage my own critical thinking.  "Is this a good idea?" "What are arguments against this?" "How would I articulate this to someone else?"  Basically, anything that forces _my_ mind to actually work with the idea, instead of just passively absorbing.
* Externalize complex ideas.  For multi-step arguments that exceed my working memory, I write down the components and work through them independently.

With that in mind, this is how I use my PKB to read \(mostly non-fiction\) books:

1. I read a book once through to get the overall picture.
2. I create a textfile with the name of the book in my `Reading/` folder.
3. I take another pass through the book and try to extract all the ideas or facts that I find interesting.  Even if you _disagree_ with it, it's often worth recording to sharpen _why_ you disagree with it.
4. I annotate these notes with my own thoughts and commentary.
5. I then cascade the interesting insights from the notes about this book through the rest of my PKB. For example, if I just read `Seeing Like A State`, then I probably have interesting ideas to cascade to my `PoliticalScience/` folder.
