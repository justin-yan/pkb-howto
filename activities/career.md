# Career

There's an infinite range of possibilities for using your PKB when it comes to your career, here are some ideas to get started:

* `Overview.md` : keep a high-level current summary of your career.
  * A list of what you've done so far with corresponding dates \(schools, jobs, etc.\)
  * What you're hoping to accomplish with your career.
  * What your important next steps are.
  * What you've learned about how you work best and the environments you enjoy most.
* A `Resume/` folder for your resume and cover letter.

### Job Folders

Keep a folder for every job you've had \(e.g. `YYYYCompanyName/` \) to include a variety of things like:

* An `AchievementLog.md` file, in which you record materially important things you accomplished.
* Copies of annual reviews.
* A `First90Days.md` file, to intentionally define a concrete set of goals for the first 90 days of any new job or role.
* A `PostMortem.md` file, for after leaving a job, in which you can reflect about interesting learnings and how they will affect future jobs that you take.

### Job Lifecycle

Keep a folder with a variety of checklists to remind you of important things to do at every stage of a job:

* **Finding a Job:** Keep a checklist of the important characteristics you're looking for in a job, as well as the important questions you want to ask.  You also may benefit from keeping some of these spreadsheets:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Overview" %}
A "Heads-Up Display" for a job search.

| Company | Phase | Channel | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CompanyA | PhoneInterview | Company Website |  |

Use a few generic "phases" \(Resume, Phone, Onsite, Negotiation\), and calculate [survival rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaplan%E2%80%93Meier_estimator) at each phase to get a sense for where you're doing well.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Brainstorm" %}
A simple place to collect ideas for where you might want to work.

| Sector | Company | Contact | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SectorA | CompanyA | My Buddy | Really Cool! |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Activity" %}
A record of everything that's happened during a job search.

| Date | Company | Phase | Channel | Result | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1970/01/01 | CompanyA | Resume | Referral | Fail | :-\( |

This log of activity can be helpful for managing job searches that run on for a long period of time \(have you already submitted a resume? what did you ask during your last phone interview?\).
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* **Negotiating an Offer:** There are a variety of great resources on how to negotiate an offer, but it can be helpful to keep a checklist to help _operationalize_ the most important tactics, so you don't forget to do them in the heat of the moment.
* **Starting a New Job:** Read a few books such as "First 90 Days" and "Deep Work", and build plans based on the new job to make sure you're doing critical things like building trust, finding work-life harmony, and keeping important principles in mind as you go through a major transition.
* **Leaving a Job:** Leaving a job can be stressful, so keep a small checklist of things to do, ranging from sending thank you notes to dealing with health insurance.  This helps minimize the worry of forgetting something important during a big transition.
