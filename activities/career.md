# Career

There's almost infinite possibilities for using your PKB when it comes to your career, here are some ideas based on things in my `Career/` folder:

* `Index.md` is where I keep the high-level current summary of my career.
  * A list of things I've done so far and their corresponding dates \(schools, jobs, etc.\)
  * What I'm hoping to accomplish with my career.
  * What my important next steps are.
  * What Iâ€™ve learned about myself regarding how I work best and the environments I enjoy.
* A `Resume/` folder where I keep the source files for my resume and cover letter.

### Job Folders

I keep a folder for every job I've had \(e.g. `YYYYCompanyName/` \) which includes a variety of things like:

* An `AchievementLog.md` file, in which I record materially important things I accomplished.
* Copies of my annual reviews.
* A `First90Days.md` file, in which I try to have a concrete set of goals for the first 90 days of any new role I take on.
* A `PostMortem.md` file, for after I leave a job, in which I try to reflect about the most interesting things I learned, and how they will affect future jobs that I take on.

### Job Lifecycle

I keep a folder with a variety of checklists that remind me of important things to do at every stage of a job:

* **Finding a Job:** I have a checklist of things that are important to me and questions to ask.  I also keep three spreadsheets:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Overview" %}
This spreadsheet is the "Heads-Up Display" for my job search.

| Company | Phase | Channel | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CompanyA | PhoneInterview | Company Website |  |

I use a few generic "phases" \(Resume, Phone, Onsite, Negotiation\), and calculate my [survival rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaplan%E2%80%93Meier_estimator) at each phase to get a sense for where I'm doing well.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Brainstorm" %}
This spreadsheet is where I collect ideas for where I might want to work.

| Sector | Company | Contact | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SectorA | CompanyA | My Buddy | Really Cool! |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Activity" %}
This spreadsheet is where I record everything that's happened during my job search.

| Date | Company | Phase | Channel | Result | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1970/01/01 | CompanyA | Resume | Referral | Fail | :-\( |

This log of activity can be helpful for managing job searches that run on for a long period of time \(have I submitted a resume before? what did I ask during my last phone interview?\).
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* **Negotiating an Offer:** There are a variety of great resources on how to negotiate an offer, but I'll keep a checklist to help me _operationalize_ the most important tactics, so I don't forget to do them in the heat of the moment.
* **Starting a New Job:** I'll read a few books such as "First 90 Days" and "Deep Work", and build plans based on the job I'm about to start to make sure I'm doing critical things like building trust, finding my work-life harmony, and keeping important principles in mind as I go through a major transition.
* **Leaving a Job:** Leaving a job can be stressful, so I have a small checklist of things to do - ranging from sending thank you notes to dealing with health insurance.  This helps minimize the worry of forgetting something important during a big transition.
