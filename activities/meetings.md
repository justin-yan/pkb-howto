# Meetings

If you find yourself interacting with a variety of people on a consistent basis, your PKB can be a great place to keep track of:

* Previous discussions: what did we discuss? what are the takeaways and action items?
* Agenda: what are topics to discuss for the next meeting?

This can be as simple as a file that looks like this:

{% code title="firstnamelastname.md" %}
```text
Agenda
======

- Ask about this new product people have been mentioning
...

Log
===

## 2020-10-16 1:1 discussion

We talked through...
```
{% endcode %}

As ideas pop into mind, you can throw them into the list of Agenda topics you have, and it's a convenient place to review notes and your last discussion before heading into another meeting.

Of course, you can use a tactic like this to keep track of any kind of recurring interaction - team meetings, job interviews, etc.
