# Decision Logs

A **Decision Log** is intended to help you form an unbiased record of your past decisions so that you can analyze how good your decision making process is.

Many industries have their own domain-specific version of this idea \(e.g. investment memos, diet journals, etc.\), but was popularized as a general concept more recently by Daniel Kahneman's **Thinking Fast and Slow**, and this Farnam Street [blog post](https://fs.blog/2014/02/decision-journal/).

Generally speaking, the point is that our brains are not actually good at evaluating the quality of our own decision making.  We tend to [re-write history to paint ourselves in a better light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias), we tend to recall examples that are [especially salient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic), and so on and so forth.  A decision log, by achieving 100% recall, should enable us to somewhat de-bias the process of answering "how good were our decisions, really?"

### How to Keep a Log

When I have a particular decision making process I'm trying to evaluate, my logging process is pretty lightweight:

* Create a folder named `<domain>_log/` .
  * For each kind of decision making process, I'll generally decide on what metadata I'm actually interested in studying.  For example, if I'm studying my ability to interview candidates, the _seniority_ of the role would be something I'd be interested in segmenting by.
* Create a file for each decision named `YYYY-MM-DD.md` .
* Record the relevant metadata for the case.
* Describe the _decision making context_: what information did I know at the time, what was my thought process?
* Describe the _final decision._
* List out any _predictions_: What do I believe is going to happen once this decision is made?
  * I often find this to be a very interesting point to revisit after 6 or so months - many times I've found that even when a decision turned out well, my predictions were often off, which often suggests that my _reasons_ for believing it was a good decision weren't right \(which is what actually matters for future decisions\).

Other than these general areas, I haven't made any templates because I typically find that different decision making processes are structurally fairly different, and therefore warrant some consideration on a per-log basis for what a good format is.

### Common Mistakes

Don't try to capture **too many** __decisions.

The entire point of using a decision log is that you will avoid _bias_ when recalling cases for study.  If, however, you are not sufficiently _selective_ about what decisions you wish to study, then you risk overwhelming your ability to **keep up** with the number of cases.  \(Imagine trying to record a decision log for every moment you chose to make\)

The moment you have too many cases, then you have to choose _which_ cases to record, which introduces [Selection Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias) in terms of the cases you have chosen to keep around for study.  How sure are you that your selection factor doesn't remove all of the examples of bad decision making?

Therefore, I only use decision logs in very _targeted_ circumstances, for very specific topics where I am sure I can keep up with the volume of cases 100%, such as investing, interviewing, or software architecture.
